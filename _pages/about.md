Hello there! I am currently working at [Hidroservice](https://www.hidroservice.cl) as an engineer, where I manage contracts, lead digital transformation projects, and develop applications. I am a retired naval officer with a BSc in Naval and Maritime Studies from the Arturo Prat Naval Academy and a BSc in Industrial Engineering from Andr√©s Bello University. Additionally, I hold a Diploma in Big Data and have completed multiple courses in data analysis.

I have expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and web scraping, and I also work as a freelance programmer. My programming languages of choice are Python and C++. In my free time, I study reverse engineering to expand my technical skills.
